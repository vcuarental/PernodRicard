THANK YOU FOR

YOUR REGISTRATION
All of us at Martell Singapore would like to thank everyone who joined us at L’Espace Martell, SAVOUR Wines. We hope you enjoyed the gastronomic journey with the Martell Gourmet Passport and the pairing dishes that were a part of Martell Projects: Chef. Your votes on your favorite chef went towards deciding the finalists of this round.



The results of this round of Martell Projects: Chef will soon be available on our Facebook page. This round’s finalists will join Chefs selected at SAVOUR Gourmet earlier this May – to compete in a final showdown at the last installation of SAVOUR 2016, SAVOUR Christmas which will take place from 17 November to 20 November. We look forward to seeing you at L’Espace Martell then.
