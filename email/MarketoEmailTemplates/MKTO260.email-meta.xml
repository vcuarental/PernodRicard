Greetings! I hope all has been well with you recently, and that the 1st quarter of the year has been excellent for you so far. I am certain that it would only get better for the rest of the year.



I would like to inform you that in addition to taking care of the Corporate and Private Sales and Partnerships, I would also be responsible for Iconic restaurant accounts. I would be more than happy to assist on any inquiries or collaborative partnership ideas involving restaurants and corporate events, as well as extending this to any queries related to matters regarding restaurants in the future.



At this moment, I am delighted to share with you the launch of our exciting, new Perrier-Jouët initiative – a club membership called “My Perrier-Jouët”. As a member of this exclusive club, you would be cordially invited to a wide range of privileges, such as having the first access to Perrier-Jouët dinners and events for the year.



To kick start this launch, Perrier-Jouët will be launching a “Season of Gastronomy by Perrier-Jouët”, where there would be a series of dinners hosted at some of the best restaurants in Singapore in the upcoming months. There would be a specially tailored menu paired with Perrier-Jouët champagnes, created by the resident head chef . A selection of these restaurants would also feature some rare vintages that are not available for sale.



By becoming a registered member, you would be one of the first to receive information about the exclusive dinners, rare collectibles preview, the Special Cuvee release in addition to the latest news about our house of Champagne.



If you are interested, please click on the website link provided below to begin your access and experience the unique, private journeys in the Champagne world.



You are receiving this e-mail because I value your opinion that you have expressed your interest with Perrier-Jouët in the past. If you are not an intended recipient of this e-mail or would no longer like to receive these e-mails, please do drop me an email!



I wish you a great day ahead and all the best to you in the rest of the year. I do look forward to meeting you at one of the upcoming Perrier-Jouet events we would be organising. Please feel free to contact me in the meantime if you have any other inquiries about this exclusive membership



Thank you.



Warmest regards,

James Ting
