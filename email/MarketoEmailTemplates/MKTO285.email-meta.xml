Under the Spell of Slayberry



Time for a DIY Martell NCF cocktail. Easy to mix, but intense on the enjoyment factor, the Slayberry Shot does indeed slay. Try one now!



Add 1 shot of Martell NCF. Then add in 1 shot of strawberry jam with warm water. Lastly, add some ice cubes for a chilled drink.
