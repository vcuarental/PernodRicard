Dear Barstars,



Hey bartenders, could you be the next Chivas Master?



Bartenders, we’ve got something to ask you. How would you like to claim the Chivas Masters HK title in 2017? More specifically, how would you like to claim the title and head off to Tokyo, yes Tokyo, to compete for the global title? By all means take your time before you answer.



The Chivas Masters 2017 is about to get underway, and the aforementioned is what’s waiting at the end of the road for one talented bartender. But all journeys have to start somewhere. In Hong Kong the journey starts now.



If you’re up for the challenge, you need to think about the unique journey of Chivas itself. From its beginnings in Scotland, Chivas has traveled the world. In New York, it was there when classic cocktails were being created and now it’s there in the emerging cocktail scene of Japan. Taking inspiration from this, Chivas Masters is inviting bartenders to go on their journey of discovery by creating three very special cocktails.



The Classic Way



Reimagine a Classic cocktail from New York, with a nod to Scotland, using Chivas Regal 12.



The Local Way



Using local ingredients or inspired by your local culture and cocktail scene to create your local way cocktail. It must be created using Chivas 12 Year Old.



The Japanese Way



The Japanese Way, pioneering a new drink with modern Japanese flavors. The Japanese Way cocktail must be created using Chivas 18 Year Old.



How to enter



As the saying goes, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. To enter submit your cocktail recipes and photographs at chivas.com/chivasmasters &lt;[[http://chivas.com/chivasmasters]]&gt; by 3rd Feb 2017. You must be 21 years old to enter. For further information, please contact chivas.hk@pernod-ricard.com &lt;[[mailto:chivas.hk@pernod-ricard.com]]&gt;.
