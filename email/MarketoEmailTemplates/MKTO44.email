<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" ><p>Dear {{lead.Salutation:default=}} {{lead.First Name:default=}},</p>
<p>A great day to you! Hope the SG50 celebrations were awesome and the recent hazy weather was not too obstructive to your lives. Heard that the haze will last till end November... :(&nbsp;If it helps, I have been told that Alcohol kills germs? Haha!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Might be a great time to get out of Singapore? Haha....</p>
<p>Well, if it helps, my marketing is going to run a very very special promotion. For the first 20 purchases of 2 cases of the Perrier Jouet Belle Epoque 2007 or just 1 case of the Perrier Jouet Belle Epoque Rose 2006, we will be flying you up for Free on 6-8th November for the exclusive launch of the Japan Exclusive Perrier Jouet Belle Epoque Limited Autumn Edition! 2 nights stay inclusive of course!</p>
<p>This will be launching next week officially and only available to the first 20 customers in Singapore. Being friends of Pernod Ricard, this is the preview for you first!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Do let me know if you are interested and I will be sure to &lsquo;Chope&rsquo; a place for you!!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,<br /> James Ting<br /><br /><i>Your purveyor of 1st Class Alcoholic solutions!</i></p>
