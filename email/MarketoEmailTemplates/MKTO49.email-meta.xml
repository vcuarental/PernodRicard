THANK YOU AGAIN FOR VISITING US AT FINE ART ASIA 2015!







Dear {{lead.First Name:default=}},



We are sorry to inform you that The Martell Tricentenaire Garden at 3812 Contemporary Art Space is currently under construction. There will be a slight delay in schedule and the Grand Opening is going to take place in late November. We are going to bring in more exciting experiences, and will inform you again when we have the confirmed date.



Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you in November.





Regards,

Martell
