    <textOnly>Hey, Greetings once again!



I have received numerous feedbacks that many of you could not enter or register on the My Perrier-Jouët website due to Event code requirements.



I must take this opportunity to apologise for the broken link that we have been rectifying over the weekend.

Please allow me to submit a very brief explanation on the error;



My Perrier-Jouët membership program that we are initiating is by invite only thus requiring the use of an event code. However you, my friends and ardent supporters of the Perrier-Jouët house are not required to do so and are automatically entitled to sign up as members directly with no conditions. There was however a glitch with the bypass link.



We have now managed to solve it and I encourage you to sign up once again on this link below to be privy to the host of privileges and benefits of being a My Perrier-Jouët Club member!


I want to become a member* &lt;[[http://marketing.pernod-ricard-asia.com/SGP_BRD_1701_PJ_MyPerrierJouet_Page_SignUp.html?cps=1]]&gt;






Again, you are only receiving this e-mail because I value your opinion that you have expressed your interest with Perrier-Jouët in the past. If you are not an intended recipient of this e-mail or would no longer like to receive these e-mails, please do drop me a personal email!



I bid you a great weekend once again and I look forward to meeting you soon at one of our Perrier-Jouët events on the near horizon! The first drink is on me of cos!



Sincerest



James Ting
