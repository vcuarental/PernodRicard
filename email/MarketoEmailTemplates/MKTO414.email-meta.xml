Be Curious at H.O.M.E. by Martell



 Take a step beyond appearances and allow yourself to Be Curious at the House of Martell Entertainment.
 
 Visit the Martell H.O.M.E. pop-up and experience a myriad of puzzles, secret room, and optical illusions that are sure to astonish and bemuse. Better yet, come with a friend and enjoy a Martell cocktail on the house.

And for a deeper appreciation of cognac, join Martell brand ambassador Pierre Boyer in the Be Curious mentoring workshop, or the Be Curious dinner by Chef Nathalie, followed by a hands-on cocktail-making session.
