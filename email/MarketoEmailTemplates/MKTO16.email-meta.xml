On behalf of Perrier-Jouët, thank you for coming to the opening of the Soho 189 Art Lane / 2014-15 Sovereign Asian Art Prize Finalists’ Exhibition during Hong Kong Art Week.
 
I hope you enjoyed the party and our Perrier-Jouët champagne, and would like to take a few minutes of your time to follow up on the below:
1. Will you be interested in joining future art-centric events?
2. Will you be interested in joining other exclusive Perrier-Jouët events, which may include champagne tastings, champagne pairing dinners?
3. Will you be interested in knowing more about Perrier-Jouët? (e.g., product information, advice on champagne/gastronomy, VIP privileges)
4. How would you like to be contacted? (via mail/email/telephone/SMS/social networking platform?)
 
Thank you once again for coming to the event and taking the time to provide such valuable feedback.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me personally if there is anything further I can do to assist.
