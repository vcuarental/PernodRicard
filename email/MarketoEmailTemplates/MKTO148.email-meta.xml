Whisky, straight up
Welcome to the discerning gentleman’s guide to the world of whisky. We’ll start with the fundamentals.




     


 


     












Do you spell it whisky or whiskey?
Depends if you’re Irish or Scottish. It’s a Gaelic spelling war that’s been raging for decades. The Irish drink “whiskey”. The Scottish drink “whisky”. We’ll let you decide who’s right.
How’s “whisky” made?
Take some barley grain, some water and heat it up in a big tall pot called a still. This process is called mashing
Then we put the whisky in oak casks to mature. Three years is the bare minimum. But we like our whiskies to have a little more life experience.
That’s all you need to do to make a great single malt whisky.
Really, all you need?
Well to be a proper single malt whisky the distilling process has to take place at a single distillery. Here in Scotland. Only Scotland. Remember there’s no “e” in single malt whisky.
