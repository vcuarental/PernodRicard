    <subject>Apocalypse Postponed -  an ABSOLUT art bar installation by Nadim Abbas</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

As part of the ABSOLUT global collaboration with artBasel we have again invited a hugely talented Hong Kong artist to create a full immersion experience known as the Absolut art bar installation.

Nadim Abbas hosts Apocalypse Postponed, a pop up, from today to Sunday, 5 pm to 2am, in Causeway Bay at the new Soundwill Plaza 2.

Come and visit, changing performances daily.

Hope to see you,
