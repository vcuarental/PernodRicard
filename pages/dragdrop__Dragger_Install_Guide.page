<h1>Thanks for installing Dragger!</h1>
<p>
Dragger uses a sidebar component in order to function.  Please follow the simple installation instructions below to begin using the Drag and Drop functionality.
</p>
<p>
1. Navigate to <a href="/ui/setup/org/UserInterfaceUI" target="_blank"> Setup &gt; Customize &gt; User Interface</a> (at the bottom of the list), and check the box next to Show Custom Sidebar Components on All Pages. 
</p>
<p>
2. Navigate to <a href="/02T" target="_blank"> Setup &gt; Customize &gt; Home &gt; Home Page Layouts </a> and edit your homepage layout. Check the box next to Dragger on each homepage layout you'll be using and you're all set (Tip: Don't confuse this with Dragger_old, that box should not be checked).
</p>
<p>
**Additional Step, if you'd like to use Dragger on pages that don't have a Sidebar**
To upload files to any page that includes a Chatter Feed, but not the sidebar (e.g. The "Chatter" page or another product such as TaskRay), we've included a Global Action.  To add this to the Chatter feed, navigate to <a href="/ui/setup/layout/PageLayouts?type=Global" target="_blank"> Setup > Create > Global Actions > Publisher Layouts</a>. Then edit your layouts to include the "Quick Upload" action.  You may also need to add the Quick Upload action to the specific page layouts you'd like it to display on.
